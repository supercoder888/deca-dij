	abstract = {Abstract:  There is an urgent need to reduce the growing backlog of forensic examinations in Digital Forensics Laboratories (DFLs). Currently, DFLs routinely create forensic duplicates and perform in-depth forensic examinations of all submitted media. This approach is rapidly becoming untenable as more cases involve increasing quantities of digital evidence. A more efficient and effective three-tiered strategy for performing forensic examinations will enable DFLs to produce useful results in a timely manner at different phases of an investigation, and will reduce unnecessary expenditure of resources on less serious matters. The three levels of forensic examination are described along with practical examples and suitable tools. Realizing that this is not simply a technical problem, we address the need to update training and establish thresholds in DFLs. Threshold considerations include the likelihood of missing exculpatory evidence and seriousness of the offense. We conclude with the implications of scaling forensic examinations to the investigation.},

	abstract = {In many police investigations today, computer systems are somehow involved. The number and capacity of computer systems needing to be seized and examined is increasing, and in some cases it may be necessary to quickly find a single computer system within a large number of computers in a network. To investigate potential evidence from a large quantity of seized computer system, or from a computer network with multiple clients, triage analysis may be used. In this work we first define triage based on the medical definition. From this definition, we describe a PXE-based client–server environment that allows for triage tasks to be conducted over the network from a central triage server. Finally, three real world cases are described in which the proposed triage solution was used.},
